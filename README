ARN Game
==================

Description
------------
ARN Game is a computer-human challenge of instruction compression.
The objective is to create as much proteins as you can from the aminoacids 
in the pool or from other proteins, while you try to dissolve other players'
ones.

Game Play
------------
Each game has two molecule pools:
- The aminoacid repository:
- The protein repository:

Each player can issue an DNA chain in its turn, composed of the letters A, C, G, T.
The length of the chain is fixed in each turn and will increase as more chains are
issued.

Each chain is processed by each one of the n ribosomes in game. Each ribosome makes
a different effect, and has a different activation pattern. The ribosomes are executed
in all the possible matches of the pattern (all the possible substrings, without 
descarding characters).

These are the default Ribosomes:

- Aminoacid creation:

- Protein creation:

- Protein dissolve:
